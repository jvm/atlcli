# Authentication

atlcli supports authentication for both Atlassian Cloud and Server/Data Center installations, with multiple profiles for different instances.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Initialize credentials (interactive)
atlcli auth init

# Check current status
atlcli auth status

# List all profiles
atlcli auth list
```

## Cloud vs Server/Data Center

atlcli supports both Atlassian deployment types with different authentication methods:

| Deployment | Auth Method | Token Type |
|------------|-------------|------------|
| Cloud (`*.atlassian.net`) | Basic Auth | API Token |
| Server / Data Center | Bearer Auth | Personal Access Token (PAT) |

**Cloud** instances use your email address and an API token for authentication. This is the default mode.

**Server/Data Center** instances use Bearer authentication with a Personal Access Token (PAT). Use the `--bearer` flag when logging in.

### API edition and feature support

atlcli targets two Confluence REST APIs: the **v2** API on Cloud and the **v1**
API on Server/Data Center. It auto-detects the edition per profile — a
`*.atlassian.net`/`*.jira.com` host (or a stored `cloudId`) is treated as
**cloud**, and anything else as **datacenter**. `atlcli auth status` reports the
detected edition, and `atlcli doctor` shows it on a successful Confluence check.

Override detection by setting `edition` on the profile (`cloud` or
`datacenter`) — useful for a Data Center instance hosted at a bare domain that
would otherwise look like Cloud.

Most commands work on both editions; atlcli routes each call to the matching
API. A few capabilities exist only on Cloud and return a clear "not supported on
Confluence Data Center" error rather than failing obscurely:

- **Folders** — a Cloud-only content type. On Data Center, docs sync represents
  the same hierarchy with pages, and a local folder node is published as an
  ordinary parent page.
- **Inline comment creation** and **comment resolution** — Cloud-only workflows.
  Reading comments (footer and inline) and adding/replying to footer comments
  work on both editions.

## API Tokens

### Creating a Token

1. Visit [Atlassian Account Settings](https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens)
2. Click **Create API token**
3. Enter a label (e.g., "atlcli")
4. Copy the generated token immediately (it won't be shown again)

### Token Permissions

API tokens inherit your account permissions. For atlcli to work fully, your account needs:

- **Confluence**: Space admin or contributor permissions
- **Jira**: Project access for issues you want to manage

## Auth Commands

### Initialize (Interactive)

Interactive setup that prompts for all credentials:

```bash
atlcli auth init
atlcli auth init --profile work
```

### Login (Non-Interactive)

Login with credentials provided via flags or environment.

#### Cloud (Default)

```bash
atlcli auth login --site https://company.atlassian.net --email you@company.com --token YOUR_TOKEN
atlcli auth login --profile work --site https://work.atlassian.net
```

#### Server/Data Center

Use the `--bearer` flag for PAT authentication:

```bash
# With token provided directly
atlcli auth login --bearer --site https://jira.company.com --token YOUR_PAT

# With keychain lookup (macOS)
atlcli auth login --bearer --site https://jira.company.com --username myuser

# With a custom CA certificate (self-signed or internal CA)
atlcli auth login --bearer --site https://jira.company.internal \
  --token YOUR_PAT --ca-file /etc/ssl/certs/company-ca.pem
```

:::note[Context paths]
Atlassian Cloud serves Confluence under `/wiki`, which atlcli appends
automatically — so Cloud `--site` URLs are bare hosts
(`https://company.atlassian.net`).

Server/Data Center instances are often served from a custom context path such
as `/confluence`. Include that path in `--site` and atlcli will route REST
requests through it:

```bash
atlcli auth login --bearer --site https://confluence.company.com/confluence \
  --token YOUR_PAT
```

Do **not** add `/wiki` to a Data Center URL — that is Cloud-only.
:::

Options:

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--site` | Atlassian instance URL |
| `--email` | Account email (Cloud) |
| `--token` | API token (Cloud) or PAT (Server/DC) |
| `--bearer` | Use Bearer auth with PAT (for Server/DC) |
| `--username` | Username for keychain lookup (Server/DC) |
| `--profile` | Profile name to create/update |
| `--ca-file` | Path to a custom CA certificate (PEM) for self-signed or internal CAs |
| `--insecure` | Skip TLS certificate verification (not recommended for production) |

### Status

Check current authentication status:

```bash
atlcli auth status
```

Output:

```
Profile: work (active)
Site:    https://company.atlassian.net
Email:   you@company.com
Status:  Authenticated ✓
```

### List Profiles

```bash
atlcli auth list
```

Output:

```
PROFILE     SITE                              EMAIL              ACTIVE
default     https://company.atlassian.net     you@company.com
work        https://work.atlassian.net        work@company.com   ✓
personal    https://personal.atlassian.net    me@gmail.com
```

### Switch Profile

Change the active profile:

```bash
atlcli auth switch work
atlcli auth switch personal
```

### Rename Profile

```bash
atlcli auth rename old-name new-name
```

### Logout

Clear credentials but keep the profile (for easy re-login):

```bash
atlcli auth logout
atlcli auth logout work
```

### Delete Profile

Remove a profile entirely:

```bash
atlcli auth delete old-profile
atlcli auth delete old-profile --delete-keychain   # macOS only
```

When deleting a profile with a keychain-backed token, use `--delete-keychain` to remove the stored credentials. Without it, keychain credentials (if any) are left intact.

## Profiles

### Default Profile

Initialize the default profile:

```bash
atlcli auth init
```

Enter your instance URL, email, and API token when prompted.

### Named Profiles

Create profiles for multiple instances:

```bash
atlcli auth init --profile work
atlcli auth init --profile personal
atlcli auth init --profile client-acme
```

Use a profile with any command:

```bash
atlcli jira search --assignee me --profile work
atlcli wiki docs pull ./docs --profile client-acme
```

### Per-Command Override

```bash
# Use specific profile for one command
atlcli wiki page list --space TEAM --profile work
```

## TLS and Self-Signed Certificates

On-premises Jira and Confluence Data Center deployments often use certificates issued by an internal Certificate Authority or self-signed certificates. atlcli supports both scenarios via per-profile TLS settings.

### Custom CA certificate (recommended)

If your instance uses an internal CA, point atlcli at the CA certificate bundle with `--ca-file`:

```bash
atlcli auth login --bearer \
  --site https://jira.company.internal \
  --token YOUR_PAT \
  --ca-file /etc/ssl/certs/company-ca.pem
```

The path to the CA file is stored per-profile as `tlsCaFile` and applied to every subsequent Jira and Confluence request for that profile. The file is read on each request, so rotating the CA bundle is as simple as replacing the file on disk — no re-login needed.

Accepted format: PEM-encoded certificates. You can concatenate multiple CAs into a single file.

```bash
# Windows path example
atlcli auth login --bearer --site https://jira.company.internal \
  --token YOUR_PAT --ca-file C:\certs\company-ca.pem
```

### Skip TLS verification (testing only)

As a last resort — for example, when debugging on a disposable test instance — you can skip TLS verification entirely with `--insecure`:

```bash
atlcli auth login --bearer --site https://jira.test.local --token YOUR_PAT --insecure
```

This stores `tlsSkipVerify: true` on the profile.

:::danger[Do not use in production]
`--insecure` disables TLS certificate validation. Any attacker with network access between you and the Atlassian instance can intercept your PAT and issue traffic. **Always prefer `--ca-file`** unless you are knowingly working against an ephemeral test system.
:::

### Inspecting TLS settings

Profile TLS settings are visible in `~/.atlcli/credentials.json` under the profile entry:

```json
{
  "name": "onprem",
  "baseUrl": "https://jira.company.internal",
  "authType": "bearer",
  "tlsCaFile": "/etc/ssl/certs/company-ca.pem"
}
```

To remove TLS settings from a profile, delete and re-create it without the TLS flags.

## Token Storage

### Config File

Credentials are stored at `~/.atlcli/credentials.json`:

```json
{
  "currentProfile": "work",
  "profiles": {
    "default": {
      "name": "default",
      "baseUrl": "https://company.atlassian.net",
      "email": "you@company.com",
      "apiToken": "ATATT3x..."
    },
    "work": {
      "name": "work",
      "baseUrl": "https://work.atlassian.net",
      "email": "work@company.com",
      "apiToken": "ATATT3x..."
    },
    "onprem": {
      "name": "onprem",
      "baseUrl": "https://jira.company.internal",
      "authType": "bearer",
      "username": "myuser",
      "tlsCaFile": "/etc/ssl/certs/company-ca.pem"
    }
  }
}
```

For Server/Data Center profiles using Bearer auth, the profile includes `authType: "bearer"` and may include a `username` for keychain lookup and optional `tlsCaFile` / `tlsSkipVerify` fields for TLS configuration.

:::caution[Security]
Protect this file with appropriate permissions:
```bash
chmod 600 ~/.atlcli/credentials.json
```
:::

### Mac Keychain (macOS)

On macOS, you can store tokens securely in the system Keychain instead of the config file. When you provide a `--username` during login, atlcli stores the token in Keychain and looks it up automatically:

```bash
# Store token in Keychain during login
atlcli auth login --bearer --site https://jira.company.com --username myuser --token YOUR_PAT

# Token is now stored in Keychain - subsequent logins can use keychain lookup
atlcli auth login --bearer --site https://jira.company.com --username myuser
```

The token is stored with:
- **Service**: `atlcli`
- **Account**: Your username

### Token Resolution Priority

Tokens are resolved in this order (first found wins):

1. `ATLCLI_API_TOKEN` environment variable
2. Mac Keychain (if username is configured in profile)
3. Config file (`~/.atlcli/credentials.json`)

### Checking Token Source

Use `--json` to see where your token is coming from:

```bash
atlcli auth status --json
```

The output includes:
- `hasEnvToken`: Token is set via environment variable
- `hasKeychainToken`: Token is available from Keychain
- `hasPatInConfig`: Token is stored in config file

## Environment Variables

Override credentials with environment variables:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `ATLCLI_SITE` | Atlassian instance URL |
| `ATLCLI_EMAIL` | Account email (Cloud) |
| `ATLCLI_API_TOKEN` | API token (Cloud) or PAT (Server/DC) |
| `ATLCLI_PROFILE` | Default profile name |

:::tip
`ATLCLI_API_TOKEN` works for both Cloud API tokens and Server/Data Center Personal Access Tokens. The authentication method is determined by the profile's `authType` setting.

For Cloud profiles, `ATLCLI_EMAIL` (or a saved profile email) is still required to build Basic auth headers, even if the token comes from `ATLCLI_API_TOKEN`.
:::

Environment variables take precedence over config files:

```bash
export ATLCLI_SITE="https://ci.atlassian.net"
export ATLCLI_EMAIL="ci@company.com"
export ATLCLI_API_TOKEN="$CI_ATLASSIAN_TOKEN"
atlcli jira search --jql "project = PROJ"
```

## Precedence

Credentials are resolved in this order (later wins):

1. Default profile in config
2. `ATLCLI_PROFILE` environment variable
3. `ATLCLI_SITE` / `ATLCLI_EMAIL` / `ATLCLI_API_TOKEN` env vars
4. `--profile` command flag

## CI/CD Usage

For CI/CD pipelines, use environment variables or secrets:

### GitHub Actions

```yaml
- name: Search Jira
  env:
    ATLCLI_SITE: ${{ secrets.ATLASSIAN_URL }}
    ATLCLI_EMAIL: ${{ secrets.ATLASSIAN_EMAIL }}
    ATLCLI_API_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.ATLASSIAN_TOKEN }}
  run: atlcli jira search --jql "fixVersion = ${{ github.ref_name }}"
```

### GitLab CI

```yaml
jira-update:
  script:
    - atlcli jira issue transition --key $ISSUE_KEY --to Done
  variables:
    ATLCLI_SITE: $ATLASSIAN_URL
    ATLCLI_EMAIL: $ATLASSIAN_EMAIL
    ATLCLI_API_TOKEN: $ATLASSIAN_TOKEN
```

### Jenkins

```groovy
environment {
    ATLCLI_SITE = credentials('atlassian-url')
    ATLCLI_EMAIL = credentials('atlassian-email')
    ATLCLI_API_TOKEN = credentials('atlassian-token')
}
```

### Docker

```bash
docker run -e ATLCLI_SITE -e ATLCLI_EMAIL -e ATLCLI_API_TOKEN atlcli jira search
```

## Troubleshooting

### Invalid Credentials

```
Error: Authentication failed (401)
```

- Verify your API token hasn't expired
- Check the instance URL includes `https://`
- Confirm email matches your Atlassian account
- Re-initialize: `atlcli auth init`

### Permission Denied

```
Error: You don't have permission (403)
```

- Check your account has access to the project/space
- For Jira, verify project permissions
- For Confluence, verify space permissions

### Wrong Profile

```bash
# Check which profile is active
atlcli auth status

# Switch if needed
atlcli auth switch correct-profile
```

### Token Expired

Atlassian API tokens can expire. Regenerate and update:

```bash
# Generate new token at https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens
# Then update
atlcli auth init --profile work
```

### Server/Data Center Auth Failures

```
Error: Authentication failed (401)
```

For Server/Data Center instances:

- Verify you used `--bearer` flag when logging in
- Check that your PAT hasn't expired (Server/DC PATs have expiration dates)
- Confirm the PAT has the required permissions in your Atlassian admin settings
- Ensure the instance URL is correct and accessible

To re-authenticate:

```bash
atlcli auth login --bearer --site https://jira.company.com --token YOUR_NEW_PAT
```

### Confluence page operations fail on Server/Data Center (404 / 405)

```
Error: HTTP 405
NOT NULL constraint failed: pages.title
```

If reads work but `wiki page create`, `wiki page update`, or `wiki docs`
commands fail on a Server/Data Center instance, your site is likely served
from a context path that is missing from the profile URL.

atlcli appends `/wiki` (Cloud's context path) only when the `--site` URL has no
path of its own. A Data Center instance hosted at
`https://confluence.company.com/confluence` must include `/confluence` in the
site URL, otherwise requests are sent to a non-existent
`/confluence/wiki/rest/api/...` path.

Re-create the profile with the full context path:

```bash
atlcli auth login --bearer --site https://confluence.company.com/confluence \
  --token YOUR_PAT
```

### Keychain Issues (macOS)

If Keychain lookup fails:

- Verify the token was stored: `security find-generic-password -s atlcli -a <username>`
- Re-store the token: `atlcli auth login --bearer --site <url> --username <user> --token <pat>`
- Check Keychain Access app for any access issues
